Implement a simple website with two subpages: user profile and user information form.

Website must contain:
* header with logo
* simple menu with navigation
* content
* footer (optional - can be just a simple placeholder with paragraph of lorem ipsum to demonstrate responsiveness)

Form should contain the following fields:
* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Phone
* Birthday
* About
* Avatar

Once the form is submitted, the content should change to profile view with data from the form. This view should contain:
* Same page header, menu and footer (SPA)
* Space for profile img
* Data completed in the form on the previous page should be displayed in separate lines.
